Hangman Game

Description
The Hangman Game is a Python-based game that allows players to guess a hidden word letter by letter. The game provides players with a set number of lives, and they must guess the word before running out of lives. T

Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to create an interactive Hangman game using Python that demonstrates various programming concepts, including object-oriented programming, input validation, and game logic. 

Once the game is running, follow these instructions to play:

You will be prompted to guess a letter by entering a single alphabetical character.

If the letter is in the hidden word, it will be revealed in its correct positions.

If the letter is not in the word, you will lose a life.

Keep guessing letters until you guess the entire word or run out of lives.

Win the game by guessing the word correctly or lose if you run out of lives.
